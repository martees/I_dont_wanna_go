Hello, hi, hello!

My name's Alex and I don't wanna go to school!

THEM'S THE RULES :

1. If a file starts with "WHEN" and I meet the conditions, I must open it and do what it says. If the file starts with "IF", I can open it, but I don't have to. 

I can only open a file if I meet the conditions.

2. IF I DONT KNOW WHAT A FILE NAME MEANS, I SHOULDN'T TOUCH IT!

3. I can put files in MY DIMENSIONAL BACKPACK. If I put files in there, I HAVE THEM. If a file says I should HAVE something, it means it should be in my backpack.

4. Play THE HORIZON OF SCHOOL. Every time it gets to the end, mom gets angrier: add 1 to MOM'S MAD. Then start the song again.

5. If you find other sound files, you get to play them only once, and you must start THE HORIZON OF SCHOOL again afterwards!
