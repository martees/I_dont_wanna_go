You no longer lose when grandma gets very mad and barges inside the room, because she can't open the door. She will instead start using her void powers to disapparate your barricade. 

Rename WHEN GRANDMA'S PISSED to THE GREEN WITCH MERIDIAN.mp3.

Copy and paste these rules into your journal:

B - If you reach GRANDMA'S MAD 4, delete THE HORIZON OF SCHOOL and replace it with THE GREEN WITCH MERIDIAN.mp3. GRANDMA DOESN'T MANAGE TO GET INSIDE YOUR ROOM. DO NOT LOSE THE GAME. Replace rule A with rule A', and delete this rule.

[A'- Play THE GREEN WITCH MERIDIAN.mp3. Every time it gets to the end, grandma DELETES 3 FOLDERS from your barricade in THE DOOR. Then start the song again. If there are not enough folders to DELETE, GRANDMA GETS THROUGH: open WHEN GRANDMA GETS THROUGH.txt.

Should you get to play other sound files, you only get to play them once! Delete them afterwards, and you must start THE HORIZON OF SCHOOL.mp3 again afterwards.]
