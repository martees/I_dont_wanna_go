You no longer lose when grandma gets very mad, because she can't open the door. She will instead start using her void powers to disapparate your barricade.

Move the other file here into the START HERE folder.

Copy and paste this rule into your journal:

"B - You don't lose the game if you reach NANA'S MAD 7. Instead, every time Morning mischief.mp3 ends, you now delete 1 folder from the barricade, then start the song again. 

If there are not enough folders, nana barges into your room; open WHEN NANA GETS THROUGH.txt."

Then delete this file.
