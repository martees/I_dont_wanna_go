This is about the adventures of my fav band, if they were actually a group of artificial demi-gods used by humanity as living weapons to fend off the threat of the carcino-marilith, weird crustacean monsters that are actually the spawns of extra-dimensional gods! I can't wait for the next opus to come out!
