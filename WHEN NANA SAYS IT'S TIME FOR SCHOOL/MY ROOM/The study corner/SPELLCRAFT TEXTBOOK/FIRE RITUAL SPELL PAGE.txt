Oh, since I've got my textbook, I could try to review the fire ritual we've learned the other day. I'm not supposed to try it at home though.

Create a folder named FIRE RITUAL and place this file inside.

To use the fire ritual, you'll need RECYCLED PAPER (to burn and to draw the runes on), BIRD SEEDS (to invoke the spirits), and a RED CRAYON (to draw the runes). 

If you manage to get all of those things in the FIRE RITUAL folder, THE FIRE RITUAL IS READY.
