Oh no! Nana was waiting for you in the street! Now you have to engage in a terrifying magic duel, as per the ancient compact!!

Read the files in here, if you can open them, to fight with Nana. Delete attacks after you've used them.

When you can't attack anymore, the fight ends. Open the WHEN THE FIGHT ENDS folder.
